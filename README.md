# ALX React App

## 📝 Description
This project is a my first React app for coursework with ALX Africa built with React.js, focusing on the fundamentals and core concepts of React

## ✨ Features
* Create and modify basic React applications and components
  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **React.js:** 
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For application logic.
* **HTML5:** For semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** For styling and responsive design.
* **Webpack:** - Module bundler for managing assets and compilation.
* **Babel:** - JavaScript transpiler for modern JS features and JSX.
* **npm:** For package management.


## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Angi-Tsh/alx-fe-reactjs.git
    ```
    Replace `Angi-Tsh` with your actual GitHub username.

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash 
    cd alx-fe-reactjs
    ```

3.  **Install the project dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server with live reloading:
```bash
npm start
The application will typically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or another configured port like 5173 if using Vite defaults).

Building for Production
To create an optimized production build of the application:

Bash

npm run build
The compiled files will be located in the dist/ directory.
